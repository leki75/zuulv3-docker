# Shared zuul config specific to the OpenStack Project
# Contains definitions of trusted jobs
# Overrides jobs from:
#    https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/zuul-jobs


# Changes to this job require a special procedure, because they can
# not be tested before landing, and if they are faulty, they will
# break all jobs, meaning subsequent corrections will not be able to
# land.  To make a change:
#
# 1) Ensure that base-test and its playbooks are identical to base.
# 2) Make the change to base-test and/or its playbooks.
# 3) Merge the change from step 2.  No jobs normally use base-test, so
#    this is safe.
# 4) Propose a change to a job to reparent it to base-test.  Choose a
#    job which will exercise whatever you are changing.  The
#    "unittests" job in zuul-jobs is a good choice.  Use [DNM] in the
#    commit subject so that people know not to merge the change.  Set
#    it to "Work in progress" so people don't review it.
# 5) Once test results arrive for the change in step 2, make a change
#    which copies the job and/or playbooks of base-test to base.  In
#    the commit message, link to (without using Depends-On:) the
#    change from step 4 so reviewers can see the test results.
# 6) Once the change in step 5 merges, abandon the change from step 4.

      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ subdirectory of the executor
      work directory to the logserver.

      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).

      A subset of what the 'base' job provides: the absolute minimum considered
      required to run for any one job.
      It doesn't set up cached git repositories, will not set up mirrors,
      doesn't validate the node, etc.
      It is meant to be used, amongst other things, to test roles and
      playbooks that would otherwise be included by default as part of the
      'base' job.
      These tasks, if required, can be included by the dependant jobs
      themselves on a need basis.
